1, Compile HDF5 VOL lib
   > cd src
   > edit Makefile to setup your compile environments accordingly 
   > make

2, Test
   > cd test
   > edit Makefile to setup your compile environments accordingly   
   > make
   > ./test
    Writing file_name = h5file-0.h5 at rank 0
    Writing file_name = h5file-1.h5 at rank 0
    Writing file_name = h5file-2.h5 at rank 0
    Read file: h5file-0.h5 back to check at rank 0
    Read file: h5file-1.h5 back to check at rank 0
    Read file: h5file-2.h5 back to check at rank 0
    [Test Passed] Read data back on BB , no error!

3, Know issue
   when you compile the code with -g flag
   it may report some error at the very end (MPI_Finalize) 
   But, it does not impact the usage of the connector
